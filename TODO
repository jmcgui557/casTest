- Fix make so that it is not necessary to source any files
- Add make target so that $(CAST_DIR)/bin is added to the path

- Do we need to use ldconfig??

- Add plugin capability (in addition to the tests) (Open/closed principle)
  -- Create a make file in $CAST_DIR/src to make a plugin for
     commands.  This will be a default plugin distributed with
     the casTest package.
  -- Move the creation of commands -addTestSuite and -about to the new plugin.
  -- Change executeCmd() to load all names of commands from all plugins, then
     load the indicated plugin (based on the command to execute).  This allows
     users to extend casTest without changing the code to the base executable.
     - also add usage() capability to plugins

- Write the manual

- Write the book
